# TODO

Failsafes

- proper colored logs and no verbose option

- Don't show /transactions/receive/ or /transactions/receive/ if there is no loaded wallet.

- breadcrumb

- only listen to 127.0.0.1  app.listen() + options

- https + user login => can use over the net

- allow to force/change the locale. top bar, use emojis?

- avoid create wallet with no name

- bis payment requests and send : check address and amount field for validity

- est. fees

- wallet server selection (link there but no route)

- "queued on the blockchain" rather than "inserted to mempool" (mempool / pool/ eggpool ??)


- modal to confirm.
- js code , data table generic
- check balance

ok - D: prefix for custom dragginator terms to translate.


- wallet version + update (auto update? => os + version)
- crystals version (api?) + update
- crystal on/off

- auto lock wallet after time out. (lock after time or 1 tx)
- pin to send tx
- warning if wallet not encrypted

- 2fa (token) to auto unlock wallet?


- api: balance server (all addresses, bis as well as tokens)
(+ reindex)
